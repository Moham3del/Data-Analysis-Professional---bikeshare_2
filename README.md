# Data-Analysis-Professional---bikeshare_2
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York, and Washington.
I wrote code to import data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics.
I also wrote a script that takes raw input to create an interactive experience in the device to present these stats.
